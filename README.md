# monash-timetable-parser

The purpose of this is to parse data from Monash Timetable (2.0.39 - https://classtimetable.monash.edu/2018/) by manually selecting units and downloading the csv file generated by the list view.

Currently, its main purpose is to parse the columns into arrays and also calculate another array that generates all the dates (ISO 8601 format) that the class will occupy.
